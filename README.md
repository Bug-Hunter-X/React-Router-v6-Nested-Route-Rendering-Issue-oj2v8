# React Router v6 Nested Route Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug encountered when using nested routes in React Router v6. The issue is specifically related to rendering a nested route within a parent route under certain conditions, which may lead to the nested route rendering nothing or the wrong component.

## Bug Description
The main problem lies in how the nested route '/contact/:id' behaves within the parent route '/contact'. The nested route does not always render correctly and may appear blank or display an unexpected component.  This is not consistent across all scenarios and seems to be triggered by certain navigation patterns.

## Solution
The solution involves careful review of the route hierarchy and possibly adding stricter path matching conditions or restructuring the routes for better predictability.
